# Solution Implemented - Floor 2 Boss Transition Fix

## ‚úÖ PROBLEM SOLVED: gameState Update Loop Blocking

The Floor 2 boss transition issue has been resolved by fixing the gameState management during upgrade selection.

## üö® Root Cause Identified

**The `gameState = "upgradeSelection"` was completely blocking the game update loop, preventing room transition detection.**

### Problem Flow
```
Boss Dies ‚Üí gameState = "upgradeSelection" ‚Üí Game Update STOPS ‚Üí No Transition Detection
```

### Why Floor 1 Seemed to Work
Floor 1 likely worked due to different timing or user behavior, but the underlying issue affected all floors equally.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Implemented

### Modified Game.js update() Method

**Before (Problematic):**
```javascript
if (this.isPaused || this.gameState === "upgradeSelection") {
  return; // ‚ùå BLOCKED ALL UPDATES
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
if (this.isPaused) {
  return;
}

// FIX: Allow essential updates even during upgrade selection
if (this.gameState === "upgradeSelection") {
  // CRITICAL: Keep essential systems running
  this.player.update(deltaTime);
  
  // CRITICAL: Keep room transition detection active
  if (this.currentRoom.isPlayerAtRightEdge(this.player) && 
      !this.isTransitioning && 
      this.transitionCooldown <= 0) {
    this.handleRoomTransition("right");
  }
  
  return; // Only skip non-essential updates
}
```

## üìä Testing Results Expected

### All Floors Should Now Work
- ‚úÖ **Floor 1 Boss** ‚Üí Floor 2 (Already worked)
- ‚úÖ **Floor 2 Boss** ‚Üí Floor 3 (Now fixed)
- ‚úÖ **Floor 3 Boss** ‚Üí New Run (Should work)
