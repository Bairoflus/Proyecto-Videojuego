# Database Normalization Analysis - Shattered Timeline

## Overview

This document analyzes the current database schema (`dbshatteredtimeline`) against the three normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to determine compliance with normalization standards and identify any structural improvements needed.

## Database Structure Summary

**Total Tables: 11**
- Authentication: 2 tables (users, sessions)
- Player State: 3 tables (save_states, permanent_player_upgrades, weapon_upgrades_temp)
- Analytics: 5 tables (player_stats, run_history, weapon_upgrade_purchases, enemy_kills, boss_kills)
- Configuration: 1 table (player_settings)

**Additional Objects: 18 security views** for column name masking and API abstraction.

## First Normal Form (1NF) Analysis

### Requirements Check:
1. **Atomic Attributes**: ✅ PASS
   - All attributes contain single, indivisible values
   - No multi-valued fields detected
   - ENUM types use atomic values

2. **Unique Primary Key**: ✅ PASS
   - All tables have auto-increment integer primary keys
   - All primary keys are properly defined and unique

3. **Primary Key Non-Null**: ✅ PASS
   - All primary keys are auto-increment and cannot be null
   - No nullable primary key columns

4. **Constant Column Count**: ✅ PASS
   - All tables have fixed column structure
   - No variable-length row structures

5. **Functional Dependency on Primary Key**: ✅ PASS
   - All non-key attributes functionally depend on their respective primary keys
   - No attributes exist independently of the primary key

6. **No Repeating Groups**: ✅ PASS
   - No repeating column groups detected
   - Related data properly separated into different tables

### 1NF Result: **COMPLIANT**

## Second Normal Form (2NF) Analysis

### Requirements Check:
1. **Must be in 1NF**: ✅ PASS
   - All tables satisfy 1NF requirements

2. **Eliminate Partial Dependencies**: ✅ PASS
   - All primary keys are single-column (auto-increment integers)
   - No composite primary keys exist
   - Therefore, partial functional dependencies are impossible

3. **Proper Table Relationships**: ✅ PASS
   - Foreign key relationships logically established
   - Related data properly separated

### 2NF Result: **COMPLIANT**

## Third Normal Form (3NF) Analysis

### Requirements Check:
1. **Must be in 2NF**: ✅ PASS
   - All tables satisfy 2NF requirements

2. **Eliminate Transitive Dependencies**: ✅ PASS
   - Analyzed each table for non-key attributes depending on other non-key attributes
   - All non-key attributes directly depend on primary keys only
   - No transitive dependencies detected

### Table-by-Table Analysis:

**users**: All attributes (username, email, password_hash, etc.) directly depend on user_id
**sessions**: All attributes (user_id, session_token, etc.) directly depend on session_id
**save_states**: All attributes (user_id, room_id, hp, etc.) directly depend on save_id
**permanent_player_upgrades**: All attributes (user_id, upgrade_type, level) directly depend on upgrade_id
**weapon_upgrades_temp**: All attributes (user_id, run_id, levels) directly depend on temp_upgrade_id
**player_stats**: All attributes (user_id, totals, etc.) directly depend on stat_id
**run_history**: All attributes (user_id, timestamps, etc.) directly depend on run_id
**weapon_upgrade_purchases**: All attributes (user_id, weapon_type, etc.) directly depend on purchase_id
**enemy_kills**: All attributes (user_id, enemy_type, etc.) directly depend on kill_id
**boss_kills**: All attributes (user_id, boss_type, etc.) directly depend on boss_kill_id
**player_settings**: All attributes (user_id, volumes, etc.) directly depend on setting_id

### 3NF Result: **COMPLIANT**

## Referential Integrity Analysis

### Issues Identified:
1. **Missing Foreign Key Constraints**: ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT NEEDED
   - Logical foreign key relationships exist but are not enforced at database level
   - This does not affect normalization but impacts referential integrity

### Recommended Foreign Key Constraints:
```sql
-- sessions table
ALTER TABLE sessions ADD CONSTRAINT fk_sessions_user 
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- save_states table
ALTER TABLE save_states ADD CONSTRAINT fk_save_states_user 
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE save_states ADD CONSTRAINT fk_save_states_session 
    FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES sessions(session_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE save_states ADD CONSTRAINT fk_save_states_run 
    FOREIGN KEY (run_id) REFERENCES run_history(run_id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- permanent_player_upgrades table
ALTER TABLE permanent_player_upgrades ADD CONSTRAINT fk_permanent_upgrades_user 
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- weapon_upgrades_temp table
ALTER TABLE weapon_upgrades_temp ADD CONSTRAINT fk_weapon_upgrades_user 
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE weapon_upgrades_temp ADD CONSTRAINT fk_weapon_upgrades_run 
    FOREIGN KEY (run_id) REFERENCES run_history(run_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- player_stats table
ALTER TABLE player_stats ADD CONSTRAINT fk_player_stats_user 
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- run_history table
ALTER TABLE run_history ADD CONSTRAINT fk_run_history_user 
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- weapon_upgrade_purchases table
ALTER TABLE weapon_upgrade_purchases ADD CONSTRAINT fk_purchases_user 
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE weapon_upgrade_purchases ADD CONSTRAINT fk_purchases_run 
    FOREIGN KEY (run_id) REFERENCES run_history(run_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- enemy_kills table
ALTER TABLE enemy_kills ADD CONSTRAINT fk_enemy_kills_user 
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE enemy_kills ADD CONSTRAINT fk_enemy_kills_run 
    FOREIGN KEY (run_id) REFERENCES run_history(run_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- boss_kills table
ALTER TABLE boss_kills ADD CONSTRAINT fk_boss_kills_user 
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE boss_kills ADD CONSTRAINT fk_boss_kills_run 
    FOREIGN KEY (run_id) REFERENCES run_history(run_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- player_settings table
ALTER TABLE player_settings ADD CONSTRAINT fk_player_settings_user 
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

## Overall Assessment

### Normalization Compliance: **FULLY COMPLIANT**
- ✅ First Normal Form (1NF): PASS
- ✅ Second Normal Form (2NF): PASS  
- ✅ Third Normal Form (3NF): PASS

### Database Quality: **HIGH**
- Well-structured tables with appropriate separation of concerns
- Logical relationships properly established
- Efficient design with minimal redundancy
- Good use of constraints and indexes

### Recommendations:
1. **Add Foreign Key Constraints**: Implement explicit foreign key relationships for referential integrity
2. **Consider Indexes**: Add performance indexes on frequently queried foreign key columns
3. **Documentation**: Current structure is well-documented and maintainable

## Conclusion

The Shattered Timeline database is **properly normalized** and complies with all three normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF). The structure is efficient, logical, and well-designed for the game's requirements. The only improvement needed is the addition of explicit foreign key constraints to enforce referential integrity at the database level.

No structural changes or table modifications are required for normalization purposes. The database is ready for production use with the recommended foreign key constraint additions.
