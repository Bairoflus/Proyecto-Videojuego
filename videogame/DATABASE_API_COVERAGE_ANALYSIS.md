## ❌ **MISSING OR PARTIAL COVERAGE (7/21 - 33%)**

### **🔴 CRITICAL GAPS**

#### **1. Boss Kills Table**
| Table | Issue | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `boss_kills` | No dedicated endpoint | Boss kills not tracked separately from encounters |

**Details:**
- `boss_encounters` tracks combat statistics
- `boss_kills` should track successful boss defeats
- Currently no way to distinguish between boss encounters and actual kills

#### **2. Player Settings**
| Table | Issue | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `player_settings` | No endpoints | Audio settings cannot be persisted |

**Details:**
- No CREATE, READ, UPDATE endpoints for player audio preferences
- Settings lost between sessions

#### **3. Player Events Logging**
| Table | Issue | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `player_events` | No endpoints | General event logging not available |

**Details:**
- Designed for comprehensive action logging
- Analytics and debugging capabilities missing

### **🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY GAPS**

#### **4. Player Statistics Management**
| Table | Issue | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `player_stats` | Only GET endpoint | Statistics cannot be manually updated |

**Details:**
- GET /api/users/:userId/stats exists
- No dedicated UPDATE endpoint for stat corrections
- Stats might become inconsistent

#### **5. Player Upgrades Management**
| Table | Issue | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `player_upgrades` | Indirect access only | Cannot query/manage upgrades directly |

**Details:**
- Only updated via purchase endpoints
- No direct GET/UPDATE for upgrade levels
- Debugging upgrade states difficult

### **🟢 LOW PRIORITY GAPS**

#### **6. Session Management**
| Table | Issue | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `sessions` | Limited CRUD | Cannot manage active sessions |

**Details:**
- Only LOGIN (CREATE) and LOGOUT (close) supported
- No GET active sessions, no force-close sessions
- Limited administrative capabilities

#### **7. Enhanced CRUD Operations**
| Tables | Issue | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Multiple | READ-only or CREATE-only | Limited management capabilities |

**Details:**
- Most endpoints are CREATE or READ only
- No UPDATE/DELETE for most entities
- Administrative and debugging limitations

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Immediate Action Required (CRITICAL)**

1. **Implement Boss Kills Endpoint**
   - POST /api/runs/:runId/boss-kill
   - Track successful boss defeats separately

2. **Implement Player Settings Endpoints**
   - GET /api/users/:userId/settings
   - PUT /api/users/:userId/settings
   - Enable audio preference persistence

3. **Implement Player Events Logging**
   - POST /api/runs/:runId/events
   - Enable comprehensive action tracking

### **Medium Term (MEDIUM)**

4. **Enhance Player Statistics**
   - PUT /api/users/:userId/stats
   - Enable manual stat corrections

5. **Direct Player Upgrades Access**
   - GET /api/users/:userId/upgrades
   - PUT /api/users/:userId/upgrades/:upgradeType

### **Long Term (LOW)**

6. **Extended Session Management**
   - GET /api/users/:userId/sessions
   - DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId

7. **Full CRUD Support**
   - Add UPDATE/DELETE operations for administrative use

---

## 🧪 **TESTING IMPLICATIONS**

### **Current State**
- **67% table coverage** is sufficient for core gameplay
- **Critical gaps** prevent complete feature implementation
- **Analytics and debugging** capabilities limited

### **Post-Implementation**
- **95%+ table coverage** expected after critical fixes
- **Complete feature parity** with database design
- **Enhanced monitoring** and management capabilities

---

## 📈 **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

### **Game Functionality**
- ✅ Core gameplay loop fully supported
- ❌ Boss kill tracking incomplete  
- ❌ Player preferences not persisted
- ❌ Comprehensive logging missing

### **Data Integrity**
- ✅ Primary game data properly tracked
- ⚠️ Some statistics may become inconsistent
- ⚠️ Limited data correction capabilities

### **Administrative Capabilities**
- ⚠️ Limited session management
- ❌ No direct entity management
- ❌ Debugging capabilities restricted

## 📞 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Review and prioritize** missing endpoints based on project timeline
2. **Implement critical endpoints** for boss kills and player settings
3. **Add comprehensive logging** for player events
4. **Enhance testing coverage** for new endpoints
5. **Update documentation** to reflect complete API coverage

> **Note**: This analysis should be updated as new endpoints are implemented to maintain accuracy with the current API state.
