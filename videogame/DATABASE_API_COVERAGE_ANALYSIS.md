## ❌ **MISSING OR PARTIAL COVERAGE (5/21 - 24%)**

### **🔴 CRITICAL GAPS**

#### **1. Player Events Logging**
| Table | Issue | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `player_events` | No endpoints | General event logging not available |

**Details:**
- Designed for comprehensive action logging
- Analytics and debugging capabilities missing

### **🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY GAPS**

#### **2. Player Statistics Management**
| Table | Issue | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `player_stats` | Only GET endpoint | Statistics cannot be manually updated |

**Details:**
- GET /api/users/:userId/stats exists
- No dedicated UPDATE endpoint for stat corrections
- Stats might become inconsistent

#### **3. Player Upgrades Management**
| Table | Issue | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `player_upgrades` | Indirect access only | Cannot query/manage upgrades directly |

**Details:**
- Only updated via purchase endpoints
- No direct GET/UPDATE for upgrade levels
- Debugging upgrade states difficult

### **🟢 LOW PRIORITY GAPS**

#### **4. Session Management**
| Table | Issue | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `sessions` | Limited CRUD | Cannot manage active sessions |

**Details:**
- Only LOGIN (CREATE) and LOGOUT (close) supported
- No GET active sessions, no force-close sessions
- Limited administrative capabilities

#### **5. Enhanced CRUD Operations**
| Tables | Issue | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Multiple | READ-only or CREATE-only | Limited management capabilities |

**Details:**
- Most endpoints are CREATE or READ only
- No UPDATE/DELETE for most entities
- Administrative and debugging limitations

## 📊 **COVERAGE STATISTICS**

### **By Operation Type**
| Operation | Covered Tables | Total Tables | Percentage |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| CREATE | 14 | 21 | 67% |
| READ | 9 | 21 | 43% |
| UPDATE | 5 | 21 | 24% |

| **LOW** | 2 | Administrative limitations |

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Immediate Action Required (CRITICAL)**

1. **Implement Player Events Logging**
   - POST /api/runs/:runId/events
   - Enable comprehensive action tracking

### **Medium Term (MEDIUM)**

2. **Enhance Player Statistics**
   - PUT /api/users/:userId/stats
   - Enable manual stat corrections

3. **Direct Player Upgrades Access**
   - GET /api/users/:userId/upgrades
   - PUT /api/users/:userId/upgrades/:upgradeType

### **Long Term (LOW)**

4. **Extended Session Management**
   - GET /api/users/:userId/sessions
   - DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId

5. **Full CRUD Support**
   - Add UPDATE/DELETE operations for administrative use

---

## 🧪 **TESTING IMPLICATIONS**

### **Current State**
- **76% table coverage** is excellent for core gameplay and user experience
- **Critical gap** limited to analytics/logging functionality
- **Player preferences** now fully supported with auto-creation and validation

### **Post-Implementation**
- **95%+ table coverage** expected after remaining fixes
- **Complete feature parity** with database design including player settings management
- **Enhanced monitoring** and management capabilities for production use

---

## 📈 **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

### **Game Functionality**
- ✅ Core gameplay loop fully supported
- ✅ Player preferences persisted with auto-creation
- ❌ Comprehensive logging missing

### **Data Integrity**
- ✅ Primary game data properly tracked
- ✅ Player settings maintained with validation
- ⚠️ Some statistics may become inconsistent
- ⚠️ Limited data correction capabilities

### **Administrative Capabilities**
- ✅ User settings management fully implemented
- ⚠️ Limited session management
- ❌ No direct entity management
- ❌ Debugging capabilities restricted

## 📞 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Review and prioritize** missing endpoints based on project timeline
2. **Implement critical endpoints** for player settings and events
3. **Add comprehensive logging** for player events
4. **Enhance testing coverage** for new endpoints
5. **Update documentation** to reflect complete API coverage

> **Note**: This analysis should be updated as new endpoints are implemented to maintain accuracy with the current API state.
